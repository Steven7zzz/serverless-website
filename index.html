                <p id="introduction"> 
                    Welcome to my webpage! I'm Haodong Luo, a passionate and dedicated 
                    individual with a commitment to continuous growth.
                    <br><br>
                    I am seeking a bachelor's degree in computer science from 
                    Texas A&M University, where I learned my skills and gained 
                    invaluable knowledge in programming. 
                    My educational journey has instilled in me a deep curiosity 
                    and a love for learning that I carry with me in all aspects of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my academic journey, I've been actively involved 
                    in a variety of class projects and practical experiences, 
                    such as data structure learning with graph algorithms, 
                    binary search trees, and the BFS DFS method, practices with 
                    C++ pointers with 2D dynamic arrays and memories, studying 
                    assembly language to design a simple CPU, and using JavaFX and 
                    java code design a GUI and APP for student's attendance. 
                    These hands-on opportunities allowed me to master my academic knowledge 
                    and enhance my problem-solving skills and creativity.
                    <br><br>
                    I bring a diverse set of skills to the table, including C++, JAVA, 
                    and various algorithms. These skills reflect my expertise in 
                    programming and enable me to tackle challenges with confidence 
                    and innovation.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond my academic life, I'm a big fan of watching anime 
                    and playing video games. My favorite mobile game is Honkai Impact 3rd 
                    and my favorite anime is K-ON! These passions enrich my life 
                    and fuel my creativity, helping me maintain a balanced and 
                    fulfilling lifestyle.
                    <br><br>
                    My guiding philosophy is "May all the beauty be blessed," emphasizing 
                    never giving up and hope for tomorrow. Which inform my decisions 
                    and actions both personally and professionally.
                    <br><br>
